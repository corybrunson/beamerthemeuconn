# UConn Beamer themes

This is a repo for the development of LaTeX themes and templates for the University of Connecticut, to complement the PowerPoint themes available on the [Brand Standards website](http://brand.uconn.edu/resources/powerpoint-templates/).

## Themes

The first task is to create the following coordinated Beamer themes:

- `beamercolorthemeuconn.sty` (Beamer color theme)
- `beamerinnerthemeuconn.sty` (Beamer inner theme, planned)
- `beamerouterthemeuconn.sty` (Beamer outer theme, planned)
- `beamerthemeuconn.sty` (Beamer theme incorporating the above)

While not yet planned, it would be useful to include poster and report templates as well.

## Use

The examples (the `.tex` files) illustrate how to use the themes in LaTeX documents.

## License

The code, including templates and examples, are [products of authorship](http://research.uconn.edu/technology-commercialization/resources-for-faculty/tech-transfer-faqs/invention-ownership-flowchart/) and released into the public domain. Wordmarks and logos are [trademarks of the University of Connecticut](http://brand.uconn.edu/standards/wordmark-and-logos/) and used with permission.
